## 1. Git repository and patch file

Objective
Single change done in a branch, translate it to another branch

General idea
### 1. We have create 3 branches in our local repository 
Branch **branch_test_patch** I added next text at the end of version M3_randomforest.ipynb

"I added this text to set up a ppatch file ".
Branch **brach_where_i_want_to_copy** is just a version of the original  M3_randomforest.ipynb

We check the change that we would like to apply to the new branch.

To remember: 
```
'branch_test_patch': where we have the change for first time
"brach_where_i_want_to_copy": branch where I want to apply the change

``` 
### 2.Checkout the branch where the change we want to replicate has been done. 
The command git fomrat..is used to create a patch file, where we write the name of the branch which is the branch where we want to apply the changes,"brach_where_i_want_to_copy" git is going to compare the 2 branches and we will get the differences in the patch file. Git will save the patch file in a directory on the project root calle 'patches'.

A directory has been created on the directory where I have crete the original git repository. This contains Ã  .txt file "0001-Text-text-patch-file".

The name of the patch file contains a sequences plus the text of the commit.

In case we have many patches created, we choose the one we want to apply. Using the hash number, using the command git log.

So we would specify the creation of a pathc file just for the commit with hash number "8b6a1d101d44747c1221ca324b972ad73bd871ef":

```
git format-patch -1 8b6a1d101d44747c1221ca324b972ad73bd871ef -o patches
```
This command tells git to fetch this single change , -1 (not a range just a single commit)

### 3.Apply the patch to the current branch.

The branch where we want to apply is "brach_where_i_want_to_copy".
So first of all we have to check out "brach_where_i_want_to_copy" with git checkout and the we write:

```
git format-patch -1 8b6a1d101d44747c1221ca324b972ad73bd871ef -o patches
```

At the end, we dont forget to stage, commit and push the changes so we have the changes in the new branch.
